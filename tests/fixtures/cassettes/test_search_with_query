        which road to go\\n[00:47.46] Been so long\\n[00:50.22] I just know I didn't
        use to wake up feelin' this way\\n[00:55.37] Cussin' myself every damn day\\n[00:59.42]
        There's always some kind of bill to pay\\n[01:03.56] People just doin' what
        the rich men say\\n[01:07.30] I wanna go home\\n[01:09.94] \\n[01:24.07] Now,
        for generations farmin' the ground\\n[01:28.43] Grandson sells it to a man,
        out of town\\n[01:32.46] And two weeks later, the trees go down\\n[01:36.66]
        Only got concrete growing around\\n[01:40.51] I wanna go home\\n[01:44.59]
        I wanna go home\\n[01:49.43] I don't know which road to go\\n[01:53.32] It's
        been so long\\n[01:56.37] I just know I didn't use to wake up feelin' this
        way\\n[02:01.62] Cussin' myself every damn day\\n[02:05.83] People have really
        gone and lost their way\\n[02:09.74] They all just do what the TV say\\n[02:13.63]
        I wanna go home\\n[02:16.42] \\n[02:30.79] If it weren't for my old dogs and
        the good Lord\\n[02:35.89] They'd have me strung up in the psych ward\\n[02:40.69]
